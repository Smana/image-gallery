# Public Library Code

This directory contains library code that can be imported by external projects.

## Structure

- Place reusable packages that could be useful to other projects
- Keep internal business logic in `/internal`
- Ensure public APIs are well-documented and stable

Currently empty - will be populated with shared utilities as they emerge.
